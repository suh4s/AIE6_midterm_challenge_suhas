When we talk about algorithms making decisions, we're not just discussing abstract mathematics – we're talking about systems that increasingly determine who gets a job, who gets a loan, and sometimes even who goes to prison. The math matters because its consequences are profoundly human.

The fascinating thing about probability is how it challenges our intuition. Take the famous Birthday Paradox: in a room of just 23 people, there's a 50% chance that at least two people share a birthday. With 70 people, that probability jumps to 99.9%.

Data never speaks for itself – it always comes with human assumptions baked in. When we look at a dataset showing correlation between two variables, we need to ask: what might be causing this relationship?
