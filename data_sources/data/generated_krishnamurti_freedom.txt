Title: The Nature of True Freedom

We seek freedom, but what is this freedom we desire? Is it the liberty to do as one wishes, to pursue ambition, to accumulate, to express oneself without hindrance? This is what the world often calls freedom. But look closely. Is the pursuit of ambition not a form of bondage to success or failure, to recognition or obscurity? Is the accumulation of things not a tie to the material, a source of anxiety over loss? Is unhindered self-expression, if born from a self that is conditioned, merely the expression of that conditioning?

True freedom, perhaps, lies not in the expansion of the self, but in the understanding of the self. The self, the 'me', is a construct of memory, of experience, of cultural and societal conditioning, of fears and desires. It is a bundle of conclusions. To be free from this self is not to destroy it in an act of will, for the entity that seeks to destroy is still part of that self. Rather, freedom comes from observing this self without judgment, without condemnation or justification.

Observe your anger, your jealousy, your fear. Do not say 'I must not be angry,' for that is another form of conflict, of division within. Simply observe it as you would observe a cloud in the sky. See its structure, its movement, its arising and its passing. In this choiceless awareness, the nature of that which is observed begins to reveal itself.

Freedom is not an end, a goal to be achieved in the future. It is in the very act of seeing, in the immediate perception of 'what is'. When the mind is no longer escaping from the actual, from the present, through ideals, through beliefs, through the pursuit of pleasure or the avoidance of pain, then there is a possibility of a different kind of freedom. This freedom is not from something, but a state of being in which the conditioning has been understood and therefore has fallen away. It is to be a light to oneself, not a follower of any authority, including the authority of one's own past experiences. This requires immense attention, a discipline that is not suppression but an active, alert observation from moment to moment.
