When we examine the current trajectory of this technology, we can identify three distinct possible futures: First, the mainstream path where incremental improvements lead to wider adoption but minimal disruption. Second, a transformative scenario where an unexpected breakthrough creates entirely new capabilities that fundamentally alter the existing paradigm. Third, a regulatory response scenario where societal concerns lead to significant constraints on development.

This current challenge resembles the fictional 'Kardashev transition problem' often explored in speculative fiction. The difficulty isn't just technical but involves coordinating systems that operate at vastly different scales and timeframes.

Looking forward to 2045, we might expect the convergence of neuromorphic computing with advanced materials science to create substrate-independent cognitive systems that challenge our current definitions of consciousness and agency.
