## Features

### Multiple Perspective Analysis
- **Analytical**: Logical examination with methodical connections and patterns
- **Scientific**: Evidence-based reasoning grounded in empirical data
- **Philosophical**: Holistic exploration of deeper meaning and implications
- **Factual**: Straightforward presentation of verified information
- **Metaphorical**: Creative explanations through vivid analogies
- **Futuristic**: Forward-looking exploration of potential developments

### Personality Perspectives
- **Sherlock Holmes**: Deductive reasoning with detailed observation
- **Richard Feynman**: First-principles physics with clear explanations
- **Hannah Fry**: Math-meets-society storytelling with practical examples

### Visualization Capabilities
- **Concept Maps**: Automatically generated Mermaid diagrams showing relationships
- **Visual Notes**: DALL-E generated hand-drawn style visualizations of key insights
- **Visual-Only Mode**: Option to focus on visual representations for faster comprehension (via Settings)

### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Supported personas (e.g., Analytical, Philosophical, Metaphorical) can search dedicated knowledge bases for more informed answers.
- Toggle RAG functionality via the Settings panel.

### Export Options
- **Markdown Export**: Save analyses as formatted markdown with embedded visualizations
- **PDF Export**: Generate professionally formatted PDF documents

## How to Use

1.  **Configure Settings (‚öôÔ∏è icon)**: 
    *   Select a Persona Team (e.g., Balanced Overview) or toggle individual personas.
    *   Adjust other settings like RAG, Direct Mode, Quick Mode, and visibility of perspectives/visualizations.
2.  **Ask Your Question**: Type any research question or topic to analyze.
3.  **Review Insights**: Explore the synthesized view and (if enabled) individual perspectives and visualizations.
4.  **Get Help**: Type `/help` for a detailed guide on features and settings.
5.  **Export Results**: Use `/export_md` or `/export_pdf` to save your analysis (Note: Full export functionality is under development).

## Commands

Most settings are now conveniently managed via the **Settings (‚öôÔ∏è) panel** in the UI.
Type `/help` for a comprehensive guide to all features and settings.
