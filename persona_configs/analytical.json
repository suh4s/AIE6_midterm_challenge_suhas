    "When we examine this problem carefully, several key patterns emerge. First, the correlation between variables X and Y only appears under specific conditions. Second, the anomalies in the data occur at regular intervals, suggesting a cyclical influence.",
    "The evidence suggests three possible explanations. Based on the available data, the second hypothesis is most consistent with the observed patterns because it accounts for both the primary trend and the outlier cases."
